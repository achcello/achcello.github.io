        <h2>9/2/16 - Coefficients</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        When testing in a wind tunnel, engineers need to achieve 
        <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Similitude_(model)" target="_blank">dimensional similarity<a/>. This means that all results can be scaled from a smaller model to a larger object. Because wind tunnels can be expensive, they are not generally full size. If we couldn't scale the results of a test, we'd be stuck building planes for cats.<br>
            <br>
            The lift and drag coefficients are non-dimensional numbers which are used in analyzing systems which are dimensionally similar. The coefficients are as given:
<br>
            <br>
            $$\displaystyle C_ L \equiv \frac{L}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _{\infty }V_{\! \scriptscriptstyle \infty }^2 S_{\rm ref}}$$

$$\displaystyle C_ D \equiv \frac{D}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _{\infty }V_{\! \scriptscriptstyle \infty }^2 S_{\rm ref}}$$

<br>
            \(L\) represents the total of all lift forces, \(D\) represents the total of all drag forces, \(\rho _{\infty }\) represents the density of the air before the aircraft disturbs it, \(V_{\! \scriptscriptstyle \infty }\) represents the freestream velocity, and \(S_{\rm ref}\) represents the reference area, usually the planform area.

<br>
            <br>
            In order to scale the model, we must maintain these coefficients by adjusting our . If testing conditions stay the same, shouldn't all non-dimensional coefficients, numbers that by nature bear no relation to the <i>size or dimension</i>
            of the subject, remain constant? It is in this manner that we can test small models in wind tunnels and achieve results that are useful to us for full scale aircraft.
