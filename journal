<h3>January 1st, 2017</h3>
I think I'm gonna start writing a jounal. I kind of want to keep track of my life as I transition into the next big part, college. This is going to be difficult as it is a rite of passage of sorts in American society. Today I took down the Christmas tree with Drew. We cleaned everything. Elisabeth left to go back to Germany. I finished Under the Dome, and it was amazing. Not quite as good as a show like Your Lie in April, but it was definitely worth the time. It's somewhat dissapointing that the show was cancelled after three seasons. The ending was left open to many new routes of story telling.<br>Hopefully I can keep this up for a year, but I have my doubts.

I cleaned the house more. I had an interview with Sam (Panner) over a video chat. He was doing a school project about music and talent. It was really nice to talk to him again. I really need to make a better effort to stay in touch with people I don't see very often.
