			<h2>2/1/17 - Updates on Plans</h2>
			<p align="justify">
I am nearly done with the plans for the wind tunnel, however I have one challenge with the end. I must figure out which fan to use. There are different types of fans, and all of them move air differently. I will consider the advantages and disadvantages of each type of fan.<br>

<h3>Box Fan</h3>

<p align="justify">
A box fan blows air through a box of wire meant to keep objects away from the blades. This fan can contain a large propeller, but the motor is often not very strong. This fan is good for a wind tunnel because of it's large area which can contribute a large volumetric flow rate even if the flow velocity is not very high. The flow velocity can be increased by decreasing the area of the wind tunnel.

<br>
<h3>Floor Fan</h3>

<p align="justify">
A floor fan has a very open construction. This makes the fan very effective for blowing air around a room, but it can't be directed easily.

<br>
<h3>Attic Fan</h3>

</center>
<p align="justify">
An attic fan is meant for a high volume circulation through air ducts. This might be more suitable for a wind tunnel as it is basically a fancy air duct.

<br>
<h3>Solid State Fan</h3>

<p align="justify">
There is no possible way to use this type of fan in a wind tunnel, but I put it in here because it's cool. Solid state fans have no moving parts; they move air by creating electrical fields and ionizing the air. The flow rate of a fan like this is almost negligible, and I think there aren't more than a few in existence.
