			<h2>10/21/16 - Lift</h2>
			<p align="justify">
Lift is not a force generally well understood. Many people have misconceptions (including me) about what exactly lifts bodies in aerodynamic flows. Air flowing around objects most definitely influences their position in space, but how does it do this? We can give the simple explanation in terms of Bernoulli's principle.<br><br>

As air flows around the wing, it takes one of two basic paths: over the wing or under the wing. The air which moves over the wing speeds up because of the larger distance to travel. The diagram below illustrates this.

According to Bernoulli's principle, the air's pressure falls as it speeds up. This creates a pressure differential which contributes lift, but is not the main source.<br><br>

Lift is mainly generated by flow turning. This is the result of the conservation of momentum and Newton's third law. Unsurprisingly, we need to think about one of the most important equations in physics,

$$\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$$

A force in once direction is equal to a mass times its acceleration in the same direction. In order to be forced upwards, the wing must exert a downwards force on the air flowing around it. According to the conservation of momentum which we discussed earlier, the change in momentum in the air, the turning of the flow, must be balanced by the change in the momentum of the wing if there are no external forces. In most analyses, the air enters the control volume (CV) without being perturbed and approaches the wing in a straight path. (This is an assumption to make calculations easier.) The flow leaves the CV with a \(\rm -\hat{j}\) (downwards) velocity.

To explain this, let's look at how a spoon behaves when in contact with a flow made of water. Although we might initially expect the spoon to be forced out of the stream because of its deflecting shape, this is not the case. The is pulled into the stream of water. From a control volume analysis standpoint, this makes sense. In the diagram above, the water enters the frame going straight and exits the frame with a momentum to the right because of its cohesion fueled acceleration around the surface of the spoon. Momentum must be conserved, so the spoon must have momentum to the left.
<br><br>
This analogue can even be taken one step further. What happens when the spoon stops moving? Eventually it reaches a velocity of zero, so its momentum reaches zero. Now we need to consider forces. We can reasonably assume that there is a gravitational force in our system. This force gains a rightward component when the spoon's center of gravity is moved to the left of its axis of rotation; it wishes to return to its lowest energy state. This force balances the leftward force created as the water leaves the spoon. This makes sense as aircraft have to stop moving upwards at some point.

The scope of the CV in this animation is not ideal as it does not extend far enough in front of the airfoil for the air to enter perfectly level. We should use this image to understand how the flow turns downwards.

This is the whole series of terms which describes conservation of momentum in a control volume.

$$\int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int _{\cal V}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(\rho {\bf V}\right)\,  {\rm d}{\cal V}+ \int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int _{S} \rho {\bf V}\,  {\bf V}\cdot \hat{{\bf n}}\,  {\rm d}S = \int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int _{{\cal V}} \rho {\bf g}\,  {\rm d}{\cal V}-\int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int _{S} p\, \hat{{\bf n}}\, {\rm d}S +\int \hspace{-1.7ex} \int _{S} \boldsymbol {\tau }\, {\rm d}S + \sum {\bf F}_{\rm ext}$$
