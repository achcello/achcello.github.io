Website for aerodynamic studies

I have created this website to document my progress in learning aerodynamics and flight vehicle design (and a little HTML too). My posts are ideally weekly, but it depends on what I'm learning. I can understand all the factors which go into aerodynamic coeffients in a couple days, but it took me a full week to understand the relationship between momentum flux and momentum flow. Consequently, to write good material may take time, so I will further parse poorly understood subjects before writing about them. If I can't figure something out, I'll right about that too.

The second half of this blog transitions into a design based inquiry. The format of the posts will be more build logs than physics heavy explanations. I hope to use a combination of physics, computer aided design, and systematic testing to create the most efficient model aircraft I can based on solar power.
