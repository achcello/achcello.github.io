Website for aerodynamic studies

I have created this website to document my progress in learning aerodynamics. I am hosting this on github because I couldn't find a suitable service, so I guess I'm learning a little HTML as well. My posts are ideally weekly, but it depends on what I'm learning. I can understand all the factors which go into aerodynamic coeffients in a couple days, but it took me a full week to understand the relationship between momentum flux and momentum flow.
