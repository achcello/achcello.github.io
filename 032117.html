			<h2>3/21/17 - Airfoil Results and Full Model</h2>
<p align="justify">
The print of the SD7037 airfoil (<iframe width="160" height="80" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/3d70ce12f69840db9ca8f17ba6c86ba1/embed?autospin=1&amp;autostart=1" frameborder="0"></iframe>) has finished. It printed more accurately than I was expecting. I oriented the shape vertically so any stripes from layers would run with the direction of airflow. This method of manufacturing airfoils is effective for prototyping, but I will try something else for the final test models.
<br><br>
For the next model, I will try to use the laser cutter for greater precision and some flexibility in materials. I also have more experience with the laser cutter. A possible solution is to cut multiple profiles of the airfoil out of a sheet of chip board along with holes for alignment. A dowel through these holes will allow proper alignment, but this might not be necessary.

<h3>Model</h3>
This model represents the final design for the wind tunnel including the adapter for the fan. The fan is 8" in diameter yet needs to attach to a 12" by 12" square cross section. The solution I have designed avoids creating too much turbulence or decreasing the volumetric flow rate too much.

I will render better images once I have access to a computer capable of doing so.
