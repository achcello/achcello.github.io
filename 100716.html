<h2>10/7/16 - Conservation of Mass and Momentum</h2>
<p align="justify">
A cube made of wire is sitting in the wind. The wind is calm and steady. In these conditions, we know exactly how much air is moving into and out of the cube and how fast this is happening. Mass and momentum must be conserved.<br><br>
The conservations of mass and momentum can help us analyze flows through a conservation-based perspective. If we know what the properties of the flow are entering a specific control area, we also know we can expect them to be at the exit.
<br><br>
Let's look at an example flow.

At the beginning of the control volume, the flow has a velocity of \(V_1\), a density of \(\rho_1\), and a pressure of \(p_1\). As the volume widens, the fluid follow the edges (\(\rm{V \cdot \hat{n}=0}\), meaning flow is parallel to the side of the control volume) and expands into the greater cross-sectional area.
