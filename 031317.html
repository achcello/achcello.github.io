			<h2>3/14/17 - Airfoils</h2>
<p align="justify">
I previously wrote about the different kinds of <a href="082616.html">airfoils</a>. I discussed my cataloging system for their models and data. I am bringing one to life now. I will print a small model of the SD3037 airfoil as a preliminary version of what I will use to test. This airfoil is the main airfoil I intend on using because of its stable aerodynamic properties at low Reynolds numbers.<br><br>

I do not expect 3D printing to give me a very good result for aerodynamic testing because there are ridges on the object as a result of the stereolithographic printing process. These could be sanded down. Another option is paint over the plastic with an epoxy resin to make a smooth, hard shell. I just began the print and will check it when it is finished.
