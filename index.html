<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
I have a curiosity for how exactly aircraft fly.<br>I want to know how different body types influence flight behavior,<br>how commercial aircraft are shaped differently than R/C planes.<br>Is it possible to create a hybrid between a quadcopter and a flying wing?
<br><br>
These questions have led me to the study of aerodynamics.<br>Eventually I will study the design of flight vehicles as well,<br>but I need to establish a working knowledge of fluid physics<br>before I can apply it. I'll be following along<br>with MIT's introductory aerodynamics class.
<h2><a href=posts.html>Posts<a/></h2>
I will post my progress along this journey every Friday.<br>In these posts, I'll be explaining what I'm learning<br>and how I anticipate using this information<br>as well as my thoughts on the matters in general.
